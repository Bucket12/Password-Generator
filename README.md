# <Password Generator>

## Description

The goal of this app is to help users create passwords for websites that need to meet specific criteria. Using starter code I have added JavaScript to this application to generate complex or not so complex passwords. When using this application the user will go through a series of prompts and selecting "OK" will confirm you would like the specific character and selecting "Cancel" is essentially saying no thank you to the specific character.

## Installation

no installation needed.

## Usage

Simply visit: "#" and click the "Generate Password" button. Next, begin using the prompts to create your password. By the end of the prompts, a password meeting your selected criteria should populate in the "Your Secure Password" field. Should the user enter criteria that is not permissable; prompts will be displayed to alert the user of the specific issue.
